This is one of my first R-Notebooks that hopefully can provide a quick easy look at the exponential
growth of the Coronavirus in various countries.

```{r}
# Reading in csv Data of COVID-19 Deaths
cd19_deaths <-read.csv("https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/total_deaths.csv", header = TRUE)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cd19_deaths, aes(x=date, y=World)) + geom_point()
```
```{r}
head(cd19_deaths)
```
```{r}
str(cd19_deaths)
```
